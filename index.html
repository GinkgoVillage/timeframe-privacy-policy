1.1 No Personal Identification Data

We do not collect any personal identification information such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical address.

1.2 On-Device Processing and Storage

Your photos and generated images are stored locally on your device only.

We do not upload or transmit images to any server.

2. Camera and Photo Library Permissions

To take photos for time-based tracking, the app requests access to your device camera.
We do not collect or store your camera content externally.

Photo Library Access

To save generated images, the app requests access to your photo library.
Your media is not shared, uploaded, or otherwise collected.

Permission is requested strictly for these functional purposes. You may disable permissions in device settings, which may limit functionality.

3. How We Use Your Information

We only use information stored locally for functions such as:

Creating and displaying your timeline

Saving and browsing past images

We do not use data for ads, analytics, or third-party sharing.

We recommend that you back up important images locally or to your own cloud

5. Third-Party Services

The app may utilize built-in system components (e.g., iOS camera and photo frameworks) to enable features, but these do not result in collection of personal data.
